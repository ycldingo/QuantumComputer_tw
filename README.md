# Promotion Program on Quantum Computing Science and Technology
The IBM Quantum Computer Hub at National Taiwan University holds a series of promotion courses nationwide. Yun-Chih Liao is one of the lecturers in the hub. This repository contains the slides, demonstrations, and related reference materials of the courses.
In the courses, we give demos by Qiskit, an online platform helping you execute quantum programs with simulators and real quantum proccessors. Before doing the so, you need to make sure that 
1. you have applied an [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) account
2. you have a Python (3.5 or later) platform in your computer
3. you have insalled Qiskit package
For the installation, please visit [here](https://github.com/ycldingo/IBMQ/blob/master/README.md).

## Normal Lectures 
These short lectures are given for audience in various background, such as the feshman, college students majoring in Finance, students in Physics department, or those from industries and engineering people.

## Open House
An open house was held on September 19, 2020 mainly for the high school students. 
- Lecture 1: Overview on Quantum Computing
- Lecture 2: [Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://github.com/ycldingo/QuantumComputer_tw/blob/master/slides/OpenHouse091920.pdf)
- [Take-home exercise](https://github.com/ycldingo/QuantumComputer_tw/tree/master/exercise)

## Others
Here, we also post some basic introduction to quantum computing. Some of the contents is in Chinese since the reader is set to be the folk in Taiwan.

## More Materials
You are suggested to visit the [repository](https://github.com/ycldingo/QuantumComputing_2020Summer) for the 2020 Quantum Computing Summer School held by National Taiwan University.
